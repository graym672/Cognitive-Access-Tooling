# Cognitive Access Tooling (CAT)

**Cognitive Access Tooling (CAT)** is a framework for turning complex, fragmented workflows into repeatable, testable, and transparent processes — especially for users with cognitive, executive, or sensory challenges.

This repo demonstrates CAT with a real-world example: converting thousands of manga JPEGs into properly structured EPUB files for Kobo eReaders, using simple scripting tools.

## Goals

- Lower the barrier to complex tasks  
- Emphasize testable steps and visible feedback  
- Preserve all versions — including failures — for learning

---

## Structure

/scripts/ → Core batch and Python scripts
/scripts/failed_versions/→ Broken or buggy versions with notes
/docs/ → Optional walkthroughs and screenshots
/output_examples/ → Folder trees, example file structures

## How It Works

1. **Real-world scripts and workflows** demonstrate how to break large or technical tasks into clear, testable steps.  
2. **Each example** is built for transparency, with visible debug output and minimal required tools.  
3. **Scripting languages like Batch and Python** are used to automate repetitive tasks, reduce errors, and increase control.  
4. **Optional compression or optimization** is used where appropriate, without compromising quality or clarity.

## Who It’s For

- Anyone overwhelmed by complex tools or interfaces  
- Neurodivergent creators, students, and professionals  
- People who prefer transparent, no-fluff automation over opaque software

---

## Requirements

- Windows OS (examples currently target Windows environments)  
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) for scripting-based workflows  
- Basic command line familiarity  
- [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) for file-based examples (optional)
